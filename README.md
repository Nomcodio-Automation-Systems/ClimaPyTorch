## Core Components

1. **Neural Network for Climate Modeling**
    - The neural network, implemented in PyTorch, approximates functions mapping input climate features (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to target outputs (e.g., future conditions or classifications).
    - **Scientific Basis**: Neural networks are particularly well-suited for capturing nonlinear relationships, which are pervasive in climate systems due to feedback loops and external forcings.

2. **Metrics for Model Evaluation**
    - Metrics such as the R2 score and divergence assess how well the model captures the variability and distribution of the data.
    - **Scientific Basis**: These metrics evaluate the model's predictive power, ensuring that predictions are statistically grounded rather than arbitrary.

3. **Data and Training**
    - The data pipeline includes CSV parsing and preprocessing, which are critical for minimizing noise and ensuring meaningful input-output mappings.
    - **Scientific Basis**: High-quality, representative data is essential for generalizable models. Training loops optimize the model parameters through iterative backpropagation.
